# Frontend for the following challenge


## Build the web app

1. We want you to create a search engine that can do the following:
* Search within the database with a text query
* Display the players that match the search criteria ( the “searchable”
attributes are: name, club & nationality)
* The displayed attributes for a search result are the following:
  * name
  * age
  * Nationality
  * Club
  * photo (should display it)
  * Overall (score)
  * Value

2. The second feature is a team builder:
* You should create a textfield in the web app where I can input a specific
budget (e.g: $200,000,000) \
  * Once the budget defined, the tool shows me a list of 11 players
that constitute the best team I can have for this specific
budget . Best player is defined from their overall score. (You
can also decide to use other attributes to define the best player if
you wish).
