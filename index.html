            All searches are performed on the attributes name, club, and nationality of all players.
            In every case a table of "exact matches" is displayed
            and in some cases an additional table of "close matches" is displayed.
            Attributes displayed are photo, name, age, nationality, club, overall score, and value.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you entered <b>one</b> word as a search term, "exact matches" includes
            all players where your search term was found as a whole word.
            "Close matches" includes any additional players where your search term was found as part of a word.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you entered <b>two</b> words as a search term, "exact matches" includes
            all players where both words were found in the same player.
            "Close matches" includes any additional players where only one
            of the two words was found. If you entered only partial words
            you will not receive any results.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you entered <b>three or more</b> words as a search term,
            "exact matches" includes all results where any of the three words was found.
            No "close matches" are shown.

            A table of 11 players will be displayed,
            msking up the best possible team you could theoretically buy
            with the amount of money you entered.

        <h2>
            Implementation
        </h2>
        <h3>
            General
        </h3>
        <p>
            This web app consists of a frontend, written in plain HTML/JS/CSS,
            and a backend written in Python.
            The two parts are completely seperate from each other and communicate
            through POST requests to predefined RESTful API endpoints
        </p>
        <h3>
            API
        </h3>
        <p>
            I decided to build a RESTful API, rather than using something more powerful like GraphQL,
            because the API needs for this project are extremely simple.
            There are only two API requests that are ever made (search, and build team)
            and the parameters passed and returned are always the same,
            making it pointless to use a query type API framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the backend I am using the web framework, Flask, along with the flask_restful module
            to host the API. Since the web hosting responsibilities of the backend are very limited
            (no web pages, only API), a minimal framework like Flask is suitable. I probably could
            have used something even simpler than Flask but Flask has a reasonable number of features,
            should you choose to use them, so it's not a bad option. In the past I have created REST APIs
            with only Flask, but after a quick Google search I found flask_restful, which seemed
            to make things simpler and suit my needs well.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Data management
        </h3>
        <p>
            I am using a PostgreSQL database to store and query the dataset. I decided to use a relational database
            because I decided from the beginning that I would perform all searches directly in SQL.
            To be honest, I also have no experience with non relational databases and I don't know how
            easy or fast it is to search through them. I chose PostgreSQL because
            it is powerful and an open source project, which I support.
        </p>
        <p>
            I interact with the database
            from Python using the psycopg2 module. This is minimalistic and gets the job done.
            However, in retrospect, I think it may have made my life easier if I had used an
            object-relational mapper like SQLAlchemy. I did not forsee the amount of data processing
            that I would be doing in the backend.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Implementation of algorithms
        </h3>
        <p>
            The search algorithm is relatively limited. Only supports up to two words.
            And it's stupid because it makes multiple SQL queries, which ends up being 
            slower because of multiple connections to db.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team builder algorithm is implemented in two steps.
            There is a Python script that I ran once at the beginning,
            which gets the position for each player and then gets their position score.
            It also processes the value from being a string into being just a number.
            It then stores the "position score" and the new value in a seperate table 
            (so as not to change the original dataset). Doing this reduces data overhead
            because I only request the position score, and not the score for every position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second step is the alorithm that runs every time the API is called.
            This then gets all players ordered by value ascending, and then iterates down the list
            checking the score agains the score of the existing player in that position,
            and if the new score is higher, and we can afford it, switches the players out.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to do all searches in sql becuase i believe that databases can process
            stuff like that just as fast if not faster than python. and searching in the db
            then returns less data which reduces overhead. Also if the data were large, or
            if the server had little ram, you wouldn't be able to store all the data in memory.
            The only thing that I've done multiple times which is stupid, is making multiple
            requests to the database. Cause that majorly slows things down.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Hosting
        </h3>
        <p>
            hosting the frontend on github pages cause it's easy and integrated with github
        </p>
        <p>
            hosting the backend on aws, cause I recently got some experience with that and I know how it works
            and it's possible within the free tier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hosting the database on ElephantSQL because it's free, has enough features, and seemed good on google.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Scalability
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first thing I would try to do is change the structure of the dataset itself.
            Please seperate first name and last name.
            Please list value as number.
            Please include position score. It's double data storing but reduces overhead (unless you can do this in sql)
            Cause with live updates the setup thing won't work
        </p>
        <p>
            I think python is good. I think SQL is good. I think Flask is good.
            I would change my algorithms so that they never
            make two sql connections for the same task.
            And I might use an ORM to make life easier. Definitely use classes for teams
        </p>
        <p>
            I would look into more efficient search algorithms.
            I would research about how effiecient it is to iterate through different data types in python (for the team),
            It probably is faster to use the cursor object, and not use key value pairs for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have no idea about hosting. I'm pretty sure that the free stuff won't continue to work.
            I guess there are multiple hosting services, and you pay for what you get.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flask should also be made secure in the hosting. Apparently I'm using a development version of flask.
